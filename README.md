# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background ## 
The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at **ALIENS-R-REAL** have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.The original collection of data was too large to search through manually. So JavaScript is used to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon the dataset provided, allowing users to filter the table data for specific values.
