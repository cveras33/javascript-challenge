# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background ## 
The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at **ALIENS-R-REAL** have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.The original collection of data was too large to search through manually. So JavaScript is used to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon the dataset provided, allowing users to filter the table data for specific values.

## General Information ## 

#### Level 1 #### 
Level 1 provides a form to filter by date/time. The user will enter a date in the format MM/DD/YYYY, if there is a match the form will display all the rows that match that criteria, otherwise the form will indicate there are no matches for that date. A screenshot of a successful date filtering is displayed below.

#### Level 2 #### 
Level 2 provides a form to filter by 5 different criteria: date/time, city, state, country and shapre. The user will enter a date in the format MM/DD/YYYY, city, state as the state's two letter abbreviation, country by its two letter abbreviation, and shape. If there is an exact match for all 5 criteria, the form will display all the rows that match, otherwise the form will indicate there are no matches for those criteria. A screenshot of a successful multi-criteria filtering is displayed below.
